# Equipment 

There are three main categories of equipment managed by the DS program.  The first are physical computers used by students for development work. The secon are Linux virtual machines maintained by campus IT (IITS) and Adam Portier.  The campus VMs are used for production versions of long-term DS projects. We are very lucky to have access to campus IT resources and we typically only deploy or update fisnished projects to these servers.  For development servers and a general low-stakes sandbox, we used VMs from Digital Ocean.  As a courtesy to our partners in IT, we have also used DO VMs for production servers.  Several haverford.edu subdomains point to DO VMs.  These were created with a request to prodesk@haverford.edu after consulting with Communications. DS is responsible for the updating and security of these VMs.  We are also responsible for renewing ssl certifications for https.
